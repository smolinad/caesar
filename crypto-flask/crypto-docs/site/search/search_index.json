If the key is not valid a warning message will be returned: If you do not give any key, the system is going to create an aleatory key for the encryption method.

Method: Add the key value to every single letter value. Example: Key = 2 Plain text = HELLO = 7 4 11 11 14 7+2 4+2 11+2 11+2 14+2 = 9 6 13 13 16 = K H N N R Encrypted text = K H N N R Affine Key: Two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(25\\) separated by a space, where \\(a\\) is relative prime with \\(26\\) . Therefore, \\(a\\) is one of these values: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 Method: Multiply \\(a\\) to every letter value in the input text and then sum \\(b\\) , module \\(26\\) . Example: Key = 2 3 Plain text = HELLO = 7 4 11 11 14 (2*7)+3 (4*2)+3 (11*2)+3 (11*2)+3 (14*2)+3 = 17 11 25 25 5 = S L Z Z F Encrypted text = S L Z Z F Vigenere Key: A word with 4 to 7 characters. Method: The input text is separated by chunks of the length of the key, and to each letter of each chunk is added the value of the letter of the key. Example: Key = LOVE = 11 14 21 4 Plain text = HELLO = 7 4 11 11 14 7+11 4+14 11+21 11+4 14+11 = 18 18 7 15 25 = S S H P Z Encrypted text = S S H P Z Substitution Key: A permutaton of the 26-letter alphabet. Method: Replace each letter in the input text with the letter which is in the same position at the key. Example: Key = BACDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ Plain text = HELLOMIA = 7 4 11 11 14 12 8 0 Encrypted text = 7 4 11 11 14 12 8 1 = HELLOMIB In the previous example, we are just replacing A for B . Permutation Key: A permutation of numbers between \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) , where \\(n\\) divides length of the text. Method: The word is separated in blocks with the same length as the key, on each block the ith letter takes the ith key number place. Example: Key = 3 1 4 2 Plain text = HELLOMIA = 7 4 11 11 14 12 8 0 7 4 11 11 -> 4 11 7 11 = E L H L 14 12 8 0 -> 12 0 14 8 = M A O I Encrypted text = ELHLMAOI Hill Key: A word in uppercase of lenght \\(n* n\\) where \\(n\\) is between 2 and 4 Method: Multiply every block of length \\(n\\) of the text (or image) by the key associated matrix . Example: Key = HSNL Plain text = HELLO The associated matrixes are \\[\\begin{bmatrix}7 & 18 \\\\ 13 & 11\\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[\\begin{bmatrix}7 & 4 \\\\ 11 & 11 \\\\ 14 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\] When multiplied we obtain the encrypted matrix \\[\\begin{bmatrix}11 & 14 \\\\ 18 & 7 \\\\ 20 & 18\\end{bmatrix} \\] Encrypted text = LOSHUS","title":"Encryption systems"},{"location":"types/#encryption-systems","text":"Let\u00b4s assume we are working with texts on English, in which the dictionary has 26 letters and are numbered as follows: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 For all methods where text is encrypted, the letters are converted to their numerical value, for example: HELLO = 7 4 11 11 14 Here on we will call the numerical value of a letter as letter value","title":"Encryption systems"},{"location":"types/#caesar","text":"Key: Integer number between \\(0\\) and \\(25\\) .
