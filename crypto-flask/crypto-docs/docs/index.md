# Welcome to Caesar Documentation


## General idea 

The purpose of this website is to encrypt and decrypt text with different encryption methods.
On the main page, there is a selection box where you can choose the encryption method:

![Recuadro metodo de cifrado](\images\ImgMetodo.svg)

This is the input text box. Here you paste the text you want to cypher:

![Recuadro texto](\images\Imgtexto.svg)
 
Below, you have the input box where you can put a key to encrypt (or decrypt):

![Recuadro metodo de cifrado](\images\Imgclavenometodo.svg)

And finally, press any button to encrypt or decrypt!

![Recuadro metodo de cifrado](\images\ImgEncriptarDesencriptar.svg)

If the key is not valid a warning message will be returned:
 
![Recuadro Alerta](\images\ImgMensajeError.svg)
 
If you do not give any key, the system is going to create an aleatory key for the encryption method. This key, aleatory or not will be shown to the user with the encrypted message.
In the navigation bar fo the page, there is a button labeled as `Image ciphers`. There, you can find cipher methods for images (currently just Hill cipher) and the page will render the form to upload the image:

![BotonImagenes](\images\ImgHill.jpg)

The other options on the page have the same instructions as the first part.
